SGROV's FANTASY NAME GENERATOR v.01

-----
BRIEF
-----

What we're trying to do here is build a fantasy generator that goes a bit further than just combining a first name and a surname.
Ideally would want something that can combine syllables together to create entirely new names.

Could put different types of name (dwarf, elf etc.) into arrays that are called when the user gives it the corresponding prompt.

Sgrov also wants to try and have some kind of function that gives bias towards more commonly used syllables.

----
PLAN
----

prompt asks player for a name type, confirm window provides a first name and surname made of different syllables with bias towards common names.
